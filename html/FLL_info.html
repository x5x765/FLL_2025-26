        <!--Problem Statement-->
        <div class="border"><h2>Problem Statement</h2><p>Our problem archeologists face is that artifacts are often found broken and need to be put back together.<br><br>

This may I pose a challenge, as they have to connect
shapes and textures to put the artifact back together. Artifacts also may be broken into thousands of pieces, so manually piecing it back may take years.
