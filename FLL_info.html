</p></div>
        <!--About us-->
        <div class="border"><h2>About us:</h2><p>We are the Blue Lucky Lego Lemons. Our team members are:Ishaan, Jashith, Reyansh, Vivaan, Drake, Viaan and Dhruva. We have 7 people on our team. All of our people are in 5th or 6th grade.</p></div>
         <!--Problem Statement-->
        <div class="border"><h2>Problem Statement</h2><p>One problem archeologists face is that artifacts are often found broken and need to be put back together.<br><br>

This may pose a challenge, as they have to connect
shapes and textures to put the artifacts back together. Artifacts also may be broken into thousands of pieces, so manually piecing it back may take years.
</p></div>
        <!--Solution-->
        <div class="border"><h2>Solution</h2><p>Our solution statement is using a scanner to make a digital model and use a computer to digitally piece it back together and tell the archaeologists how to put it back together. <br><br>Once we make the scanner, we can scan the artifacts and fossils so that they understand what the fossil is once it is pieced together. It is very useful to scientists because they can know the whole artifact pieced together, and they will know how to piece the pieces together which will save a lot of time for the scientists.</p></div>
        <!--Why we chose this problem-->
        <div class="border"><h2>Why we chose this problem</h2><p>We chose this problem because we think scientists need to use a lot of time to put the artifact together for no reason when they could be doing something else. Our team chose this problem because artifacts are important in finding how communities sustain their culture. It could take a long time to put the pieces back together. Our team thought this problem was the most important out of all because scientists definitely do not like to spend a lot of time piecing together the artifacts because they don't even know where the pieces go and our solution statement could help them know where everything goes. We chose artifacts and pottery because if you piece them together you can get an image that can tell you about ancient human life and about where the artifact originated.</p></div>
